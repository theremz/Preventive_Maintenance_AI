# Preventive_Maintenance_AI

Context:

The following project uses real failure data with the goal of doing preventive maintenance. The term unit will be used as a synonym of parts. The unit could be a machine, a motor or any other kind of mechanical part. Since the model presented has been put into production for a client, it is not possible to present all the key features and data. This project is shared to present how machine learning algorithm could be used to do preventive maintenance instead of corrective maintenance. The goal of this preventive maintenance project is to improve production efficiency, planning, client satisfaction and to reduce cost.

The methodology will take into account the production constraint of the client. Comments and explanation will be added during the project to better explain the thought process and model chosen at the end.

Methodology:

1- First data extraction and data wrangling

2- Review of possible variables impact on the Unit

3- Datasets creation

4- Creation of the first model

For step 1 to 3, please see document Data_Prep.ipynb and document Model_Training.ipynb for step 4.
