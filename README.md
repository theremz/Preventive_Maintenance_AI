# Preventive_Wheel_AI

Context:

The official name of this project is the preventive wheel program. The railway industry is one of the oldest history in the world. There advancement toward a data-driven culture is a slow and perilous one. A major problem with all types of equipment is the preventive maintenance. The metal monsters that are used to carry the passengers or merchandise can go for thousands of kilometers without needing any kind of maintenance (or do they). During this project, we will review the impact of corrective maintenance of train wheelsets on the operations, clients and cost. We will then apply machine learning algorithm to move from a corrective maintenance to a preventive maintenance. 

*** Comments and explanation will be added during the project to better explain the thought process

Methodologie:

1- First data extraction and data wrangling
2- Data profiling 
3- Review of possible variables impact on the wheelsets
4- Datasets creation
5- Creation of the first model

Even thought we were able to create a decent model, we will try to push it up a notch

6- Creation of a new dataset using summation of events on wheelsets
7- Timseseries creation
8- Testing of new model

Why stop there when we have fun:

9- Creation image based on timeseries event
10- Use of pre-trained neural network model
